4)copy WinSW.NET4.exe and sample-minimal.xml file from https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw/releases and paste them in the same folder

5)rename sample-minimal.xml to WinSW.NET4.xml and modify the xml as follows

	<configuration>
	  
	  <!-- ID of the service. It should be unique accross the Windows system-->
	  <id>Spring-Boot-REST</id>
	  <!-- Display name of the service -->

6)open a command prompt in Administrator mode and go to that newly created folder and execute the following command

  WinSW.NET4.exe install
